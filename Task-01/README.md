# Task 1: World Population Distribution Visualization

## ðŸ“œ Problem Statement
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

## ðŸ’¡ Analysis & Insights
This analysis visualizes the distribution of world country populations in 2022. The key findings from the histogram are:

* **Extreme Skewness:** The population data is heavily right-skewed. A vast majority of countries have populations under 100 million.
* **The Power of Log Scale:** A standard linear scale would render the chart unreadable due to outliers like China and India. By applying a logarithmic scale to the y-axis (number of countries), the distribution across the full range of populations becomes clear.
* **Population Gaps:** "The chart reveals significant gaps where very few countries exist within certain large population ranges, emphasizing the concentration of global population in a small number of super-countries."
